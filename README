Malana is my Zig GPU API/engine project that utilizes Vulkan. It has Slang reflection for generating pipeline layouts and type-safe access to shader variables utilizing comptime, a render graph, a math library, a VSOP parser for getting orbital elements andd a *lot* of random junk. I'm still working on cleaning everything up.
